-----
SpatialRanking plugin for Gephi
-----

This plugin is not usable with the released version of Gephi 0.8 alpha, until the next update of some Gephi's APIs (Graph API, Attributes API and Ranking API).

If you do want to use it currently, you have to install Gephi source code - more information at http://gephi.org/developers/intro.
